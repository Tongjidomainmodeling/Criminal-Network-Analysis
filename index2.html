    <p>
        In this section, an overview of previous works in the domain of criminal network analysis has been firstly
        provided, and then comes to the concept of community structure and structure detection method. Finally, we
        present a comprehension on the two relevant works about its advantages and limits.

        <b>A. Criminal Networks Analysis</b> <br>
        In the last thirty years, many efforts have been used in order to analysis the Criminal Networks in a more
        intelligent way. One of the most important research in the CNA domain is due to Malcolm Sparrow [18], who
        summarized
        four features of the Criminal Network, namely, i) limited dimension — CNs are often composed of few thousands
        entities; ii) incomplete information — criminal networks are unavoidably incomplete and erroneous; iii)
        undefined
        border — it is difficult to pick out all the relations of each entity; and, iv) dynamism — new relations always
        indicate constant evolution of network structure.
        Fortunately, this contribution lead to a trend that researchers tried to analyze Criminal Networks with the
        techniques in the domain of the social network analysis. For instance, Baker and Faulkner [3] studied illegal
        networks in the field of electric plants and Klerks [11] concentrated on criminal organizations in the
        Netherlands.
        Silke [17] and Brannan et al. [5] acknowledged a slow growth in the terrorism network and examined state of the
        art
        in criminal network analysis. Arquilla and Ronfeldt [2] summarized previous researches and proposed the concept
        of
        Netwar with its application to terrorism.
        However, in 2006, a popular work by Valdis Krebs [12] applied network analysis in conjunction with network
        visual-
        ization theory to analyze the 2001-09-11 terrorist attacks. This work represents a starting point of a series of
        academic papers in which social network analysis methods become applied to a real-world case, differently from
        previous work where mostly toy models and fictitious networks were used. Krebs paper inspired further research
        in
        network analysis for the design of better SNA applications to support intelligence agencies in the fight against
        terror, and law enforcement agencies in their quest fighting crime.

    <p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through
        them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit
        the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

    <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to
        create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple,
        blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to
        copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
