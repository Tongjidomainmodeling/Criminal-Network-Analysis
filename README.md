This repository is to support our paper titled
["RESEARCH NOTES: A PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY FOR CRIMINAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WITH INTERACTIVE STRATEGIES(116)"](https://tongjidomainmodeling.github.io/Criminal-Network-analysis/papers/ijseke_zhou.pdf)
revised at IJSEKE 2016.

This paper was submitted to IJSEKE Special Issue on Selected papers from SEKE2016 as research notes.
Due to that reseach notes are limited to ten pages including figures, references
and appendices, so we here provide some details that can't be fully shown in the paper.
We hope this can make our readers more easy to understand the process proposed in our paper and the case study
with a real world criminal dataset.
