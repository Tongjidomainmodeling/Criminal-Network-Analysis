This repository is to support our paper titled
["Research Notes: A Proof of Concept Study for Criminal Network Analysis with Interactive Strategies(116)"](https://tongjidomainmodeling.github.io/Criminal-Network-analysis/papers/ijseke_zhou.pdf)
revised at IJSEKE 2016.

> This paper was submitted to IJSEKE Special Issue on Selected papers from SEKE2016 as research notes.
> Due to that reseach notes are limited to ten pages including figures, references
and appendices, so we here provide some details that can't be fully shown in the paper.
> We hope this can make our readers more easy to understand the process proposed in our paper and the case study
with a real world criminal dataset.
